[Topic 1 - Advanced OOP]----------------------------------

Adhere to the well established standards for OOP such as:
The DRY principle and the SOLID principle.
The code is split into separate classes with 
individual goals in order to avoid repetition and dependancy.
This helps the implementation of new features at a later time.


[Topic 2 - Version control (Git/GitHub)]------------------

Here is a link to the public GitHub repo.
https://github.com/Flintiflushko/RGBMadness/network

The method of working consisted of creating a new branch for 
every small feature and merging when the feature was considered
done.

In the folder of THIS file you can see screenshots of the 
repository branches.
